#Greedy Algo
##solution Possible:
O(n^2)
O(nlogn)
O(n)

O(n^2)

Run nested loop and find the pair which give sum as target

O(nlogn)

Sort the array based on elements value in ascending order then run the 2 pointers looking for target sum 

O(n)

Iterate from one end of the array, maintain unordered_map/hash_map/array to store the element encountered so far and at each element 
check if the target-cur_element_value is there in hashmap or not if there we found are answer otherwise we need to proceed further.
